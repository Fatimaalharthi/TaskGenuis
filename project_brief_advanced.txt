Project Title: InnovateX Product Launch - Phase 2

Project Manager: PM

Timeline: October 1st - December 15th

Team Members: Alice, Bob, Charlie

Project Goals:
Successfully launch the "AI-Powered Analytics" feature for our InnovateX platform. The primary objectives are to drive 500 new user sign-ups within the first month and achieve a customer satisfaction score of over 90% for the new feature.

Key Deliverables & Tasks:

1.  **Develop "AI-Powered Analytics" Feature (Due: November 15th)**
    *   This is the core technical deliverable. Alice is the lead developer for this. The feature needs to be robust, tested, and fully integrated. This will involve designing the user interface, building the backend services to process data, integrating the machine learning model that provides the insights, and performing rigorous quality assurance.

2.  **Prepare Go-to-Market Materials (Due: November 30th)**
    *   Bob will lead the creation of all marketing and sales assets. We need a comprehensive set of materials to support the launch. This includes writing a compelling press release, designing a full suite of social media graphics and ad creatives, producing a short promotional video highlighting the feature's benefits, and updating the main product landing page with a new section for AI Analytics.

3.  **Sales & Support Team Enablement (Due: December 5th)**
    *   Charlie is responsible for getting our internal teams ready for the launch. The sales team needs to understand how to sell the new feature, and the support team must be equipped to handle customer inquiries. Charlie will need to create detailed training documentation and feature guides, hold a formal sales kickoff meeting to present the feature, and update the company's CRM system with new lead capture funnels specific to this campaign.

4.  **Official Launch & Post-Launch Monitoring (Due: December 15th)**
    *   This is the final push. Alice will handle the technical deployment to the production environment. Once live, Bob will monitor server performance and user engagement metrics closely. Charlie will execute the public announcements, including posting on all social media channels and sending a launch-day email blast to our entire user base and subscriber list.

Notes:
All designs from Bob require final approval from the PM. We need to ensure brand consistency. A feature freeze will be implemented on November 10th to ensure a stable build for final QA.
